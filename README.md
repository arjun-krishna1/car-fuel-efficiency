![](assets/covid.jpeg)
- I conducted linear regression inference on a dataset to determine the most fuel-efficient car design using Python and the Scikit-Learn library

- I processed a dataset containing 43,156 rows, 83 columns and 477,061 missing values for analysis using the Numpy and Pandas libraries in Python

- I used data visualization techniques and the matplotlib library to choose the best linear regression algorithm for the dataset to minimize overfitting
